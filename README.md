# vector-math

## Overview

Zero dependency library for performing fommon vector calculations. The library can handle 2D/3D vectors.

### Note about previous version (v1.0.1)

The library was originally written back in 2018, but has since been re-written to make use of an ES6 class instead of separate functions. The original functions were included in the re-write to maintain backward compatibility, but they will be deprecated in a future release.
